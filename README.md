# Text Translation POC

## Overview
This Proof-of-Concept (POC) demonstrates the implementation of a basic text translation solution using a pre-trained machine translation model. The solution translates given input text into a specified target language using the selected model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.0
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- Pre-trained machine translation model (e.g., facebook/mbart-large-cc25, vasudevgupta/mbart-bhasa-guj-eng, facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M, facebook/mbart-large-50, google translate)

- Thank You
